# 🔐 Quantum Key Distribution (BB84) – Educational Simulation

This repository contains an educational implementation of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol.
The project demonstrates how two parties can establish a shared secret key using quantum principles, and how the presence of an eavesdropper affects the security of the communication.

The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on clarity, learning, and conceptual understanding rather than production-level optimization.

## 🎓 Purpose

This project was developed strictly for educational purposes, as part of learning and experimenting with:

Quantum communication principles

Quantum circuits and measurements

Security guarantees of quantum mechanics

Quantum Computing

It is intended for students and anyone interested in quantum information and cryptography.

## 👥 Collaborators

This project was developed collaboratively by:

Mario Martínez
Aymane Elamrani
Marcos Molina
Alejandro Duque

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is not intended for real-world cryptographic use.
It serves as a conceptual and educational demonstration of the BB84 protocol.
